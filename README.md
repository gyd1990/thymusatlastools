#### Paper Reproduction 

This folder contains an R package with code to reproduce the analyses in our 2018 *Immunity* paper. The R package contained in this folder is built around [Seurat](http://satijalab.org/seurat/) version 1.4. Consult the package index and documentation (`?knn_classifier`, `?custom_feature_plot`, `?FetchDataZeroPad`, `?get_ortholog`) for more information. To get started reproducing our figures, open up `main.Rmd` from the companion repo `maehrlab/thymusatlasanalysis`. 

We're passionate about reproducibility, so if you have any trouble, please contact `eric epu kernfeld bu vnbttnfe epu fev`, where the address has been one-letter shifted to hide from robots.
